# Summary

The goal of this project is to create a self-driving rc car using Raspbery Pi and a camera. The logic of steering the vehicle is done through TensorFlow on a combination of dashcam footage and iterations of the model.

# Objective

To reinforce our knowledge of electronics, machine learning and image processing in a team environment
